        <h2>My favorite hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love sports. My favorite sport is basketball, and I love to watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association">NBA</a>. My favorite team is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers">Philadelphia 76ers</a> because I am from Norristown, PA, which is near Philly.
            I also like football, even though I don't play it. I love to watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League">NFL</a>. My favorite team is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> for the same reason as my favorite NBA team.
            Another hobby is video games, specifically on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>. My favorite Nintendo franchise has to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario">Mario</a> because ever since the Mario games seemed fun to play.</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am 22 years old, born in Norristown, Pennsylvania. I am Indian, which means my religion is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">Hindu</a>. Some people may think that I am funny, smart, or cool.
            I currently live in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and have been living there for almost 20 years. My birthday is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_7">May 7, 2001</a>.</p>

        <h2>My education</h2>
        <p>So, to begin, I went to grade school at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkiomen_Valley_School_District">Perkiomen Valley School District</a> from 2008-2020. After graduating from grade school, I started college by doing two years at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County_Community_College">Montgomery County Community College</a> and now transferred to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Berks">Penn State Berks</a>, where I plan to graduate in 2025. My major is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">Information Technology</a>.
            I started with computer science, which I found challenging, but I changed to IT because I thought it would be a bit easier for me. Even though IT is similar to computer science, there is one difference where it has a more focused approach to computers, like hardware and networking components.</p>

        <h2>About Hinduism</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, one of the world's oldest religions, encompasses a vast and diverse set of beliefs, practices, and traditions. Rooted in the ancient civilization of the Indian subcontinent, Hinduism lacks a single founder or centralized religious authority, allowing for a rich tapestry of theological, philosophical, and cultural expressions. Central tenets include the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma">dharma</a> (moral and social duties), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma">karma</a> (the law of cause and effect), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha">moksha</a> (liberation from the cycle of reincarnation). Hinduism embraces a multitude of deities, each representing different facets of the divine, with major gods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma">Brahma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva">Shiva</a>, and goddesses like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati">Saraswati</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmi">Lakshmi</a>. The religion's scriptures, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas">Vedas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads">Upanishads</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>, and epics like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a>, serve as foundational texts. Rituals, ceremonies, and festivals play integral roles, fostering a sense of community and connection to the divine. Hinduism's flexibility and inclusivity contribute to its enduring vitality, accommodating a spectrum of beliefs and practices within its fold.</p>

        <h2>South Indian Heritage</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India">South India</a>, celebrated for its rich cultural legacy and diverse landscapes, encompasses states like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala">Kerala</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana">Telangana</a>. With its lush greenery, historic temples, and a tapestry of languages, the region seamlessly weaves tradition and modernity. My familial roots are deeply embedded in South India, as both my parents and extended family originate from this enchanting part of the country. This connection not only influences my cultural identity but also shapes my traditions, values, and perspectives. Embracing the region's culinary delights, classical arts, and warm hospitality, I take pride in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India">South Indian heritage</a>, a unique and integral part of my identity.</p>
